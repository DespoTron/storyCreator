VALUES (1, 'Sally Gilbert was an ordinary woman, leading and underwhelming life, who had even more underwhelming friends. She couldn''t necessarily explain it but often she found herself grasping for the right words to describe her every day routine: gray?, boring?, oatmeal? She was starving for tiniest shake-up in her humble life, a simple hello from a stranger on walk to work in the morning, a juicy scandal to read in the Topeka Times, even an little earthquake to wake her in the middle of the night. But mundanity is well-oiled machine and Sally wasn''t much of a risk taker, so the cogs of existence kept meshing. That was until one weekend, on her weekly brunch date with Lisa, Adam, Kelly with a "y", Kellie with an "ie" and George, that a hungry dog with three tongues approached her table.',

VALUES (2, 'I can no longer smell scent of the lilacs. It could be the layer of residue that now blankets my third floor apartment. It could also be because I haven''t been able to step outside without a hazmat suit in three or four years. It may also be because there are no more lilacs, at least not for a 100 hundred mile radius. In fact, little that is green grows here anymore. Only shades of flaxen as far as the eye can see. The last time I saw a flower was in the former U.S., probably 5 years ago.',

VALUES (4, 'It was a Tuesday evening and the sound of the 6 O''Clock News could be heard in households all across London. It was a old report recored 5 days ago and placed on repeat (propbably by the last tech left at the BNC) when the disappearances started happening. It is here we find Daryll Southerland in his kitchen searching for an adequate meal that doesn''t involve conduction or convection. What happened can be likened to a rapture or sorts but everyone who disappeared also happened to be the schmucks of the world. This was a welcomed surprise to everyone left behind, by the latest counts some 2 billion decent people, including Daryll. However, Daryll cleaned the flat while his boyfriend, Jim cooked the meals. Unfortunately, Jim was one of the disappeared.',

'I couldn''t sleep last night, or the night before, or the seven nights before that. There''s now a cot in my office where the floor lamp once stood. I''ve found that it''s simpler to sleep at work than to return home every night. There''s no one to return home to, not anymore at least. Eight days ago we received a message, a warning from the beyond. The galactic address placed the message in the approximate location as planet Earth and it was dated from the same day, in the same year as our now. The sender was Willow Seekle.
