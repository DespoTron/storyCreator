VALUES (1, 'Sally Gilbert was an ordinary woman, leading and underwhelming life, who had even more underwhelming friends. She couldn''t necessarily explain it but often she found herself grasping for the right words to describe her every day routine: gray?, boring?, oatmeal? She was starving for tiniest shake-up in her humble life, a simple hello from a stranger on walk to work in the morning, a juicy scandal to read in the Topeka Times, even an little earthquake to wake her in the middle of the night. But mundanity is well-oiled machine and Sally wasn''t much of a risk taker, so the cogs of existence kept meshing. That was until one weekend, on her weekly bruch date with Lisa, Adam, Kelly with a "y", Kellie with an "ie" and George, that a hungry dog with three tongues approached her table.',

VALUES (4, 'It was a Tuesday evening and the sound of the 6 O''Clock News could be heard in households all across London. It was a old report recored 5 days ago and placed on repeat (propbably by the last tech left at the BNC) when the disappearances started happening. It is here we find Daryll Southerland in his kitchen searching for an adequate meal that doesn''t involve conduction or convection. What happened can be likened to a rapture or sorts but everyone who disappeared also happened to be the schmucks of the world. This was a welcomed surprise to everyone left behind, by the latest counts some 2 billion decent people, including Daryll. However, Daryll cleaned the flat while his boyfriend, Jim cooked the meals. Unfortunately, Jim was one of the disappeared.',
